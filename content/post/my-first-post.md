## What is this?
This is my first Hugo site, and the theme is powered by the amazingly clean and compact TopHat theme! 

## What can it do?
Well, because this entire site was written in MarkDown, a very easy to use "programming language" changes can be made very easily!
MarkDown supports the HTML basics, such as bold text, italicized text, headers, underlined text, etc. so I will attempt to use them in the section below!

## A quick demonstration!
Hey! This is just me testing the __amazing__ **Hugo** theme called ___Top Hat___
And maybe I am looking to embed some code snippets?
```py
import os
import sys
print(os.version)
```
No problem! Beautiful syntax highlighting for many languages.
The interface is similar to Discord. Discord also supports basic MarkDown formatting.

Okay cool. Now you see some python but what if I want to write in another language?
```js
if (confirm("Are you sure you want to do this?")) {
    console.warn("Alrighty then...")
    window.reload();
}
```
Okay yeah that is super-duper cool. I will for sure be using this!!

# Conclusion...
So now we know that Hugo is amazing and that TopHat theme is wonderful!

# But wait! One more thing!
